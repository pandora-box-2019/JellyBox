# Pandora Box Files (Adapted from IMADE3D JellyBox)

Hello maker!

Welcome to Pandora Box, a 3D printer designed for kids. Our goal was to make a printer that could print common objects like an apple using Early Learning Center materials such as model magic and Play-Doh. After two weeks of work, the Pandora Box was born! 

Pandora Box's design was based on the JellyBox 2, a 3D printer developed by IMade3D, and then modified to suit our mission. The material that will be used for the prints is a homemade and reusable dough, the recipe of which you will find in this guide. Pandora Box is controlled by a unique platform using Octopi's software to provide an accessible, safe, and fun experience for its users. 

It wouldn't have been possible to complete our goal if it wasn't for the support we received. With that, we would like to give a special shout-out to Filip Goc, a co-creator of the JellyBOX; Shenzhen Lankeda Technology Co.; Shenzhen Yuda Crafts Co.; and the amazing faculty of Avenues Mastery Academy Shenzhen 2019. 

Lastly, we hope that you can learn, explore, and potentially improve the Pandora Box, which is now an Open Source printer.

We wish you great discoveries!

Best,

Pandora Box team


## GCODE
- this is what you want it you want a **fast and easy spare part**
- **pre-sliced files ready to print** on your JellyBOX
- both cold and heated bed are fine
- depending on the filament and ambient temperature, heated bed is beneficial for some parts
- these are the gcodes we use for production
- well, we usually plate the parts many time (to print 16 clips at a time for example), but it's _equivalent gcode_

## STL
- STL files are the most common 3D exchange file
- pro: any slicer can process stl files
- con: stls are difficult to modify precisely - if you need to be changing the files, get STEP, IGES, or something like that...

## RLD
- rld files are used for laser cutting
- these are ready-to-lasercut

## Pandora Box is an open source project
  We reinforce that Pandora Box was a printer based on the designs of IMADE3D's JellyBox which is a OS printer. Despite this aspect we believe in the culture of sharing. With that, all the files needed to make/modify a Pandora Box are here. 
  
  We are excited to see what can be improved in this printer!

#### License specific answer:
CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - now

We do love the remix culture, however, we do this for a living, and research and development of hardware AND of the build experience is incredibly arduous, resource intensive, and plainly expensive. We are building a network of licensed trainers and licensed manufacturers (Franchisees - interested? We strike good deals. Shoot us a message.), and we need to be able to guarantee our partners a competitive advantage at the beginning.

Thus, we publish the files under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license. This allows anyone to print spare part to fix their printer, remix the parts, hack the heck out of it, even build a whole new project on top. Yet, this is not strictly Open-Source as the Open Source Hardware Association would tell you, but it is a common practice, it's within RepRap guidelines, and most people in fact do consider this open source. Even the original versions of GNU allowed non-commercial clause!
